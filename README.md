# Heart-Rate-Test
This project show cases the correlation between heart rate during a workout over time.
After downloading the Test file, you can creat a CSV with the to sheets in it by right clicking and click move or 
copy and with the copy save it as a CSV file, then you can get it to work with python.
I used Python 3.9.10 for this but I know it works with other versions as well.
